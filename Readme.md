## Welcome

Hello and welcome, I am [Frank Contrepois](https://zt.frankcontrepois.com/About+me/About+me+-+index), and this is my Digital Garden, where I learn in public. This is where I store or index new learning and discoveries,  connecting them with my current knowledge.

# How to navigate a brain
As a real brain, there are two sides to it: the left side, also known as the [digital-brain](https://zt.frankcontrepois.com/Left-side/Left+side+of+the+brain+index), is very logical and structured, and the right side, the [creative-brain](https://zt.frankcontrepois.com/Right-side/Right+side+of+the+brain+index), filled ideas, lessons learned, and mental models.

Another way to navigate my brain is to pick a topic or a how-to. A topic is an area of interest, and a how-to is one or more notes that tackle a specific area of improvement.

# Details on the project

[Start here - My second brain](https://zt.frankcontrepois.com/Start+here)

You can see it as a Wikipedia of my brain or a second brain, where I can get back to my thoughts and be surprised by how concepts connect one to another.

The rules of the game are described in the [Digital Garden Terms of Service](https://zt.frankcontrepois.com/Other/Digital+Garden+Terms+of+Service)

This is a bird's eye view of all the notes. The [left side](https://zt.frankcontrepois.com/Left-side/Left+side+of+the+brain+index) is about logic and technology. The [right side](https://zt.frankcontrepois.com/Right-side/Right+side+of+the+brain+index) is about being better and sharing my knowledge.

## Disclaimer
I prioritise getting data in the system over making it perfect. So please excuse typos, grammar, and other mistakes - there are many. 

# Thank you
This project is made possible thanks to [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) and [Obsidian Publish](https://obsidian.md/publish). I'd like to also thank [Sho Umi](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC525q2RIufHjnaHOuIUFY9A) for providing an excellent intro to the [Zettelkasten](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOSZOCoqOo8). And last, and by far the most important [[Rich Miller]] for starting it all :)
