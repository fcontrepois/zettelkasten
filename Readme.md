## Welcome

Hello and welcome, I am [Frank Contrepois](https://zt.frankcontrepois.com/About+me/About+me+-+index), and this is my Digital Garden, where I learn in public. This is where I store or index new learning and discoveries,  connecting them with my current knowledge.

# How to navigate a brain
As a real brain, there are two sides to it: the left side, also known as the [[Left side of the brain index|digital-brain]], is very logical and structured, and the right side, the [[Right side of the brain index|creative-brain]], filled ideas, lessons learned, and mental models.

Another way to navigate my brain is to pick a topic or a how-to. A topic is an area of interest, and a how-to is one or more notes that tackle a specific area of improvement. 

## Topics
- [[topic - my core beliefs]]
- [[topic - live a great life]]
- [[topic - having a great relationship]]
- [[topic - communicate effectively]]
- [[topic - learning]]
- [[topic - personal efficiency]]
- [[topic - information management]]
- [[topic - leading and managing]]
	- [[zt - the concept of strategy]] as a cardinal note
- [[topic - negotiation and sales]]
- [[topic - mentoring, advising and coaching]]
- [[topic - learning to learn]]
- [[topic - simplification]]
- [[topic - mental models]]
	- [[how to make better decisions]]
- [[FinOps - index|FinOps]]

# Details on the project

You can see it as a Wikipedia of my brain or a second brain, where I can get back to my thoughts and be surprised by how concepts connect one to another.

The rules of the game are described in the [[Digital Garden Terms of Service]]

This is a bird's eye view of all the notes. The [[Left side of the brain index|left side]] is about logic and technology. The [[Right side of the brain index|right side]] is about being better and sharing my knowledge.

## Disclaimer
I prioritise getting data in the system over making it perfect. So please excuse typos, grammar, and other mistakes - there are many.
