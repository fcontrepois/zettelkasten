# Welcome to my Digital Garden

## Welcome

Hello and welcome, I am [[About me - index|Frank Contrepois]], and this is my Digital Garden, where I learn in public. This is where I store or index new learning and discoveries,  connecting them with my current knowledge.

# How to navigate a brain
As a real brain, there are two sides to it: the left side, also known as the [[Left side of the brain index|digital-brain]], is very logical and structured, and the right side, the [[Right side of the brain index|creative-brain]], filled ideas, lessons learned, and mental models.

Another way to navigate my brain is to pick a topic or a how-to. A topic is an area of interest, and a how-to is one or more notes that tackle a specific area of improvement.

# Details on the project

You can see it as a Wikipedia of my brain or a second brain, where I can get back to my thoughts and be surprised by how concepts connect one to another.

The rules of the game are described in the [[Digital Garden Terms of Service]]

This is a bird's eye view of all the notes. The [[Left side of the brain index|left side]] is about logic and technology. The [[Right side of the brain index|right side]] is about being better and sharing my knowledge.

## Disclaimer
I prioritise getting data in the system over making it perfect. So please excuse typos, grammar, and other mistakes - there are many.
