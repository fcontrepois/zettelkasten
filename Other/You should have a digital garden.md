You should have a digital garden.  
  
A digital garden is a place where to store your ideas, connections, and thoughts. A digital garden is a place to grow creativity to feed minds. As a real garden, most of the work and initial delights are for the gardener; with the hope that the never finished garden will be a place of relaxation and learning.  
  
With my digital garden, I make my learning public and accessible for others to look at, expand and participate.  
  
I structured my garden as a brain, with a right side about creativity, soft skills and being a better person. The left brain is about IT, Cloud, and cloud finops.  

You should do the same. Like gardening, digital gardening is good for you (and me).
