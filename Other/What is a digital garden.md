## Notes

A digital garden is an online space at the intersection of a notebook and a blog, where digital gardeners share seeds of thoughts to be cultivated in public. Contrary to a blog, where articles and essays have a publication date and start decaying as soon as they are published, a digital garden is evergreen: digital gardeners keep on editing and refining their notes.

Another characteristic is the navigation: while a blog may usually be explored in chronological order, a digital garden uses bi-directional linking—or at least lots of internal links—to connect notes together. Such interconnection creates a trail of ideas that readers can follow.

A digital garden is a place where you can cultivate your ideas and share them with others in an open and exploratory way. It is a collection of notes, links, and other content that you can use to organize and reflect on your thoughts, experiences, and learning. Digital gardens are typically created and maintained on the web, using tools like blogs, wikis, or personal websites. They are often characterized by their emphasis on personal growth, experimentation, and connection with others.

In a digital garden, you might keep track of your progress on a particular project, document your thoughts and insights on a particular topic, or share resources and ideas with others. Digital gardens are often designed to be flexible and organic, allowing you to add and rearrange content as your interests and priorities evolve. They can be a useful tool for learning, self-reflection, and communication, and can help you build and maintain a personal online presence.
