Cloud trader. 

I work in Strategic Blue since November 2017. 

Strategic Blue does three remarkable things:
1. using trading technics to manage Cloud commitments
2. reverse-engineering AWS billing engine to audit test the CUR file and manage cost allocation as customers need
3. supporting the building of FinOps practices with real expertise in Finance, Technology and procurement.
