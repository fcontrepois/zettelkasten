# Do you want to try making a Zettelkasten?
## It all starts with reading

Start by watching this video describing the workflow I use.

In details 
- When I read a book, I always have with me a set of [5x3'' cards](https://smile.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B003VVU6L8/)
- At the beginning of a book, I write a new card for the book. 
- While reading the book, every new idea gets its own card, with reference to the book card, by writing the number of the book card in the top-right. 
	- I use **my own words** to express the idea, adding connections to other cards and significantly all the context that might be needed to remind me of the concept. 
- I keep those cards together and usually wait some weeks or months before rereading them to let the initial enthusiasm of the book fade away. ( Otherwise, I would think everything is important. )
- I usually review a card per day and read it, deciding if its content is worth adding to my current knowledge. If the answer is yes, I either update an existing note or create a new one in Obsidian and publish it on this website.
