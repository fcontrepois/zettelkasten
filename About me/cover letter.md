Hello, first of all, I'm the guy with the big red glasses.

I'm a person with lots of successes and failures. Happy to discuss both.

I love to learn, and I love to share what I learn. And when I learn something, I learn it fully, often by finding a job in that speciality.

Over the last 20 years I have done, CTO, FinOps specialist, Head of Operations, Product lead, senior consultant, Virtualisation and cloud specialist, developer project management, database specialist, and other.

 But where I really thrive is *in chaos.* When teams are to be built from scratch or help existing team who lost their motivation and compass.

If I were to summarise it all, it would look like:

with numbers: 1 wife, 2 kids, 5 languages, many tech certifications, 11 schools, 5 countries, 1 startup, 40 people managed over 3 continents.

Started being a Geek, a real one, like the one wanting not to talk to people, only systems. Luckily that changed as I discovered that in the end, it is all about humans.

I founded a company in Italy, becoming its CTO (Coblan). We grew from removing viruses on people's computers to managing life-critical healthcare data centres. Ask me about it.

Then a call from Cisco to work on a multi-million dollars project and leading development teams. I never did that, so I said yes. It was a success. I moved to Virtustream to work as pre-sales initially and ending working as a coordinator with 40 devs over 3 continents with good conversation at C-level.

At that time, I did a post-graduate diploma in non-executive director from the Financial Times to better understand a board of directors' drivers and responsibilities.

Virtustream got acquired by EMC and became boring.

So my wife, our kid and I moved to Reunion island (near Mauritius) for a year of holiday and welcoming our second son. Ask me about it, it is amazing.

Back in London, I have happily hired in Strategic Blue, a financial company (finance, something complex and new, as I love) working on the Cloud. To get it, I passed all five AWS certifications in 3 months and started working in sales; then I managed pre-sales, then support and operations, more recently I built the consulting practice, always making sure my teams do amazing work without needing me. During COVID this converted into a strong focus on building an asynchronous team. 

In the last year, I focused on FinOps creating articles and doing FinOps consulting for S&P500 companies.

I write often, usually blog posts, professional articles

à bientôt and have a great day

Frank
