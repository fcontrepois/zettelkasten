# Firewall
- [Main page](https://cloud.google.com/)


# Tech thinks to remember
- by default there are firewall rules to allow access on rdp, ssh, IMCP, and internal communication.
- firewall rules can use ip addresses, or network tags, or service accounts.
- access to the metadata server (`169.254.169.254`) is always allowed.
- Access to external servers on port 25 (SMTP) is blocked.
