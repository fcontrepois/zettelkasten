# Web Security Scanner
- [Main page](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/concepts-web-security-scanner-overview?hl=en)


# Tech thinks to remember
From the main page: 'Web Security Scanner identifies security vulnerabilities in your App Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), and Compute Engine web applications. It crawls your application, following all links within the scope of your starting URLs, and attempts to exercise as many user inputs and event handlers as possible. Currently, Web Security Scanner only supports public URLs and IPs that aren't behind a firewall.'
