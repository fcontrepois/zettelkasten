I am working, very slowly, on creating an Obsidian plugin to display [Observable Plot](https://observablehq.com/plot/) graphs in Obsidian.

[Creating an Obsidian plugin - Official documentation](https://docs.obsidian.md/Plugins/Getting+started/Build+a+plugin)

I have to stop trying to create the plugin as it requires either running random code inserted by the user (never a good idea) or putting in place complicated protections that I am not competent in creating and that exist in [Observable](https://observablehq.com/). So for now, no Plot in Obsidian, but there is a great Vega plugin that you can use.
