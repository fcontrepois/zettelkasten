Hello, I'm Frank Contrepois; welcome to the FinOps part of my second-brain where I will report on my learning and knowledge around Finance and Cloud. 

FinOps is nascent and you and me can help shaping it. 

_This is an experiment, so it will have mistakes, will change without notice, and is very in need of your expert input!_
improved documentation

# [[CUR - index|CUR study ]]

The AWS Cost and Usage Report is how AWS shares detailed information about usage and costs. It is a massive set of files with millions of rows, ever-changing columns, and a logic that confuses everyone. But it is very transparent in connecting AWS usage with spend, but you need a tool and some logic to make sense of it. 

The CUR is the big topic I want to start with. I use the CUR on a daily basis to get information. The CUR is almost a mythical knowledge; no-one seems to understands it fully and when there is light at the end of the tunnel something will change and making it a new place to discover. 

Just in case you missed the URL  in the title, here is it again :) [[CUR - index|CUR study]].

Hello, I'm Frank Contrepois; welcome to the FinOps part of my second-brain where I will report on my learning and knowledge around Finance and Cloud. FinOps is a nascent specialization and you might find that my opinions are not always aligned with what others are saying.
