## AWS CUR File
This section is about the AWS Cost and Usage Report. I find the CUR documentation incomplete; this is my attempt to contribute, by adding the content I would love to see. 

![[CUR fields - index]]

## Concept hidden in the CUR
- [[amortisation]] almost empty
- [[billing period]]
- [[how the CUR should be]]
- [[Questions you can ask a CUR file]]
- [[Regions and availability zones]]
- [[Reserved Instances]] this one is big
	- [[Size Flexible Reserved instances]] a complement to RIs
-[[Separation of infrastructure and software costs]]
- [[Savings plans]] also big

## CUR Note structure 
The structure is not set in stone; if a section needs adding or removing, it will be, and notes written previously might have a different format. The important thing is that notes are helpful.

The structure I follow as of 2021-11-06:
-   Name
- Sometimes, a short description in plain English
-   Source and documentation links
-   Connection with other parts of the CUR fields
-   Some additional notes
