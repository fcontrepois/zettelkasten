## Notes
The type of bill that this report covers. There are three bill types:

-   **Anniversary** – Line items for services that you used during the month
	-   This is the type of billing that you will see the most. It is about consumption
	-   I find the name "Anniversary" confusing  
-   **Purchase** – Line items for upfront service fees
	-   RI upfront fees [[to check]]
	-   Marketplace fees [[to check]]
-   **Refund** – Line items for refunds
	-   This include special pricing like [[PPA]], or [[Egress Waiver]]
