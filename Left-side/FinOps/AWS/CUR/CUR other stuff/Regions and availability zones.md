# Regions and availability zones (AZ)

#level100 #cur #finops 

## Source
- [AWS documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/)

## Relevant notes
- Sometimes also referred to as location in the CUR
- [[AWS region code]]

## Notes
- A region is a cluster of datacentres located in the same country or city. 
- An Availability Zone (AZ) can be seen as a single datacentre in a region
- AZ should be far enough from each other not to be impacted by most disasters with a reduced blast radius (think plane crash, but not earthquake) but close enough to allow for ultra-low latency networking.
