# Observable

If you know me, you know I love data, databases, and data visualisation. So for my next tech exploration, I wanted something new—otherwise, what exploration would it be—with lots of data. 

I think I found it.

For many years I enjoyed what the Data Driven Document ([D3S](https://d3js.org/)) was doing but never took the time to actually implement anything with it. My imperfect (read non-existent) knowledge of Javascript being the first barrier; time being the second barrier. 

Now there is [Observable](https://observablehq.com), which might have existed for years without me knowing. Observable uses the concept of notebooks, often used with Python (another language that I never learned), to create beautiful pages where code, text, and graph co-exist happily.
