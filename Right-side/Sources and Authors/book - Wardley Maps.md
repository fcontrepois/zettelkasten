# Good and bad of Wardley maps
Wardley maps have many positives and one big negative:
- They help create a visual language that is grasped easily.
- They help build discussions and people can provide ideas and debate
- They help define what should be delegated, what should be done in-house
But they do not tell you the speed of movement to the right. You 'know the future' but do not know when the next movement will happen. Maps reduce risk by providing clarity, and speed of market movement is where business acumen (or luck more probably) should be focused...
