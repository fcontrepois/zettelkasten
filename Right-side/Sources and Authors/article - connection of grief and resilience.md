When we lose something important, there is a natural process that is the same for everyone and that I call the 8 phases of grief.

Persons that manage to go through all the phases fast have **resilience**. Let me repeat, resilience is simply the capacity to "get over it".

 From the outside resilient people will rebound, be determined, courageous and able to *adapt*. This last one is the most important because as Darwin said:

> It is not the most intellectual of the species that survives; it is not the strongest that survives; but the species that survives is the one that is able to adapt to and to adjust best to the changing environment in which it finds itself - Charles Darwin in his “Origin of Species.”

ps: I made this discovery while doing my Zetterkasten, which is an amazing tool to map your thought and make discoveries like this one. Let me know if you'd like a training.
