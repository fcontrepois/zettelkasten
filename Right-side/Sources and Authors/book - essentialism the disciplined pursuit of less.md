# Summary
The book tells how, in the author opinion, it is better to focus on a very limited of things fully, than to try to do many partially. 

## Essentialism in three words
Less but better

Essentialism is about focusing energy on the least amount of things, making it:
- about choice
- about focus
- about freedom of mind
