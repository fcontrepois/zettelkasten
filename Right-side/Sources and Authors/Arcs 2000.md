Station de ski

# Notes 
- Use all the passports matching the border control
- When arriving at Bourg Saint Maurice using the Eurostar the funicular is on at the opposite of the station, so going against where everyone goes is correct.
- Avoid Shuss as a restaurant; it is bad and expensive 
- Saveurs des cimes is good for buying cheese and rent equipment for raclettes
- Savoy is good for dinners. The 1.2Kg meat was great
- Sherpa is the local supermarket 
- **Aiguille grand fonds** is great as a location, you get out directly on the slopes and just where the kids' classes are. Very small!
