# Summary
A great documentary about social media.

The Social Dilemma is an American docudrama film directed by Jeff Orlowski and written by Orlowski, Davis Coombe, and Vickie Curtis. It goes into depth on how social media's design is meant to nurture an addiction, manipulate people and governments, and spread conspiracy theories such as Pizzagate and aiding groups such as flat-earthers.
