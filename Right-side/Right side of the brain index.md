# The right side - creativity, connections and emotions
#index 

Hello, this is the right side of my second brain. This site is about creativity, connections and emotions.

I use the Zettelkasten method to collect, connect and keep this repository updated.  

![[Emotions.jpg]]

It all started with a feeling. I'm sure you also had the same feeling:  reading a book, finishing it, feeling inspired and â€¦ not remembering more than one of two ideas. Even worse, after a week, all the notes, the underlined paragraphs, and folded corners miss so much context that they are now meaningless. 

The Zettelkasten allows me to keep most of those good ideas in a single place and extend my knowledge on topics I care about. 

So what is a Zettelkasten?

![[36171465_s.jpg|200]]

**A Zettelkasten** connects ideas, concepts, behaviours, and thoughts I had while consuming information (mostly reading). The content focuses on topics I care about. The connections help create new ideas and discover paths between otherwise unconnected thoughts. [[Do you want to start your own Zettelkasten]]?

More recently, I've been introduced to mental models, and I feel they deserve a dedicated section and explanation.

**The Mental model library** ([[topic - mental models]]) contains, unsurprisingly, mental models. Mental models are well-known, catalogued and well-defined ways to help better thinking and better decision-making. Compared with the notes of the Zettelkasten, mental models are not "original" but are time-tested. Knowing as many of them as possible can help make better decisions and hopefully generate new ideas for the Zettelkasten.

Each  note contains
- Source - where is this idea coming from. This can be a link to the literature note
- Topics - high-level areas of interest
- How to - what is this note helping do
- Relevant notes - connection with other permanent note
- Notes - This should be content that can be copy-pasted directly into a document
