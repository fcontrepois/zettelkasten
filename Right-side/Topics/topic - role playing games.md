# Role Playing Games
This is an important part of my life as it allowed me to keep in touch with a limited amount of very important people. 

Currently I am enjoying playing or wanting to play:
- Dungeon World (actively playing with a group of friends)
- Kult divinity lost (I love the game but it is too gore for any of my groups and possibly for myself)
- Call of Cthulhu 7th edition
