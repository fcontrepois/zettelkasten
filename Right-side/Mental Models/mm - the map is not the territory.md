# The map is not the territory

#mentalmodel

## Source

- https://fs.blog/2015/11/map-and-territory/
- [[book - Wardley Maps]]

## Keywords (topics and howto)

- [[topic - mental models]]
- [[how to make better decisions]]
- [[how to avoid common biases (brain shortcuts)]]

## Relevant notes

- [[zt - avoiding common biases]] - for many people, the model creates its own reality

## Notes

- A map is an abstraction of reality that place things logically. By being an abstraction, a map loses information to save "space."
- Mental models are maps. Any approximation, rule of thumb and shortcut is a map
- A map is incorrect
  - A 1:1 map is useless. What you want is a reduction of reality in a way that serves you.
  - A map is always incorrect but can be very useful
  - A map is a snapshot in time of reality. It represents something that does not exist anymore.
  - A map needs interpretation, which can be flawed in its own right
  - All models are wrong, but some are useful." — George Box
- Having a map versus not having a map is a huge improvement.
- Knowing where you are on the map is critical to use a map, as is having a sense of direction and movement [[book - Wardley Maps]]
- Past worst cases are a terrible indicator of how things can go wrong in the future
  - Using the past to build a model predicting the future is limited by the extent of the past. The worst case is based on what we know but might be different in the future
  - "worst case" event happened in the past, you would have _not_ been using the coming "worst case" as your worst case because it wouldn't have happened yet. - Nassim
- !!! When the map and terrain differ, follow the terrain.
- We create complicated models to give us a feeling a control. The model is a map, and the more complicated the model the more fragile it is as more and more assumptions are backed in it. Better more model each with a limited number of known assumptions.
