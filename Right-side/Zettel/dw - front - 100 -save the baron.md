# Dangers

## The Duke of Notsosure
*Impulse:** Misguided Good - to take the crown as the king in weak

The Duke feels that the army is strong enough to attack the neighbouring countries and expand the kingdom while the weak king is caring for the masses.
### Grim Portents
- Arrest the Baron
- King comes to Chenesacio
- Baron kills the King and is arrested
- Duke takes the power as the highest authority

**Impending Doom:** Usurpation, and tyranny
## The Goblins and Vampires
**Impulse:** to survive, to breed, to multiply and consume

The Goblin are starving. The new king is using the army to protect people and not for war resulting in protected villages that cannot be attacked. 
### Grim Portents
- Get the bush of blood (defended by the school of Magic)
- Capture the dogs of blood using the bush of blood
- Force the vampires to attack first or be eaten by the dog
- Send the Goblin legions to get all the food

**Impending Doom:** Invasion of the barony and its food reserve
## Unholy Ground  
Impulse: to spawn evil

After generations of suicides and in the end, the son of the king being murdered in that same place made the bottom of the cliff an Unholy ground. From the blood and the newly created magic, four vampires emerged, and one was killed by the dogs of blood. Other unholy things might come out of the earth. 
### Grim Portents
- Let more unhappy living-dead come out of the earth
- Make many people around the place dream of dying on that spot to gain eternal <something>
- Gain more blood to awake as many dead as possible and connect with other existing Unholy grounds

# Description and Cast
- **Gerits, Duke of Notsosure**, wants to be king and be known as a glorious war leader. Does not care for the people which he sees as vermin to be used for his goals.
- **Bartolo, Baron of Chenesacio**, weaker than expected and under the influence of the Duke. 
- Three new vampires (**Oana, Edwin and Hacan**), very confused and afraid of the light, the people and the blood dogs
- **Gurio**, killed by the baron at the cliff on a blackmail order from the duke. Gurio was a bastard of the king that could have threatened the usurpation plans of the duke.
- **Gtydik the smart, wizard-king of the Goblins**, and mastermind behind the involvement of the School of Magic to help control the vampires.

Near Nocomprendo, a small village in the Barony of Chenesacio under the Duchy of Notsosure, there is a cliff. That cliff is, unfortunately, used by people with desires of death. So much so that there is a place where most people use, creating an unfortunate place to look for disappearing people. Ten years ago, the oldest son of the Baron was found there dead. Since then things have slowly changed, with a convergence of negative powers. People's weaknesses and excesses are now stronger.

# Custom Moves
- When you look from the cliff while the bush is not there 10+ you get visions, remember them and do not act on them, 7-9 you get visions that you forget, but you feel an impulse to jump and resist it. 

# Stakes
