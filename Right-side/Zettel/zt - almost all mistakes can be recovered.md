## Notes
As a manager, do not hesitate to delegate to your most recent joiners. 

In my experience, they will almost always do well. If there is a problem, you, as the escalation contact, can act and resolve the issue.
This approach is particularly useful when you need fast onboarding for customer-facing positions.
