## Notes

### reflect back

- Reflect back what the other side said. It is a great way to keep being connected and helps [[zt - get to that is right]] while making sure we got the ideas correctly
- As [[zt - feedback is always welcome]] reflecting back is a good way to get a two-sides feedback
  - In a fast conversation where there is little time say first the urgent, then the important
  - In a long conversation, start with the important then at the end the urgent

### do not interrupt

- do not interrupt the person in front of you will tell you when they want you to talk.

### better overcommunication than undercommunication

- when in doubt, share the info
- do the communications on your own. Do not assume others are doing it. Get certainty about important communications, both that they are send end received and understood

### Make it explicit

- By making things explicit you remove assumptions made by both sides.
- By reflecting back your understanding you are making explicit your point of view while inviting the other side to pitch-in [[zt - communication techniques]]
