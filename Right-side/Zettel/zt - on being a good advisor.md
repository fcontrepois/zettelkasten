## Notes
- *A trusted advisor is above all someone who is capable of totally and completely devoting himself, his caring and his attention to the client.*
-  An advisor is not only right but also helpful. Knowledge needs to be mixed with a real focus on the customer
-  The ==political fights are for the customer==. To arm the customer for such fights it is important that the advisor ==provides reasons, not instructions==. 
      - It is the advisor responsability for the proper mutual understanding. So clarifiying questions should be coming from the advisor
- An advisor is an expert guide in the process of reasoning through the problem
            - give them options
            - give them education about the options (in depth)
            - give them a recommendation
            - ^^let them choose!^^
                - if forced use "if it was my company or money I would do X" 
			- In particular in the advisory world, [[book - The Trusted Advisor]] p 178-180

	- to be sold to
	- feel their business is like all the others
	- see few signs that we are listening
	- be romanced
- clients want their advisor to:
	- make an impact on their business
	- do more things "on spec"
	- spend more time helping think and develop strategies
	- lead our thinking. How will the business look in 5 years
	- Jump on new data
	- schedule some off-site meetings
	- make the effort to understand how the business works
	- let them know how they compare to others
	- tell why competitors are goind what they are doing
	- discuss other things we should be doing
- The value of the service delivered by an advisor:
	- understanding
	- sense of control (like using the getting to know method in [[zt - negotiation techniques]])
	- access and availability
	- responsiveness
	- reliability
	- appreciation
	- sense of importance [[zt - diplomacy is needed to work with the powerful]]
