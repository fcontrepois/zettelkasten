## Notes
- When making some decision, specially important ones, try to always limit the loss but not the payoff. 
	- When you get shares in a startup, you know you might lose the shares, with a clearly defined value, but if the company goes well you have no clue on how much you could make. In the same way, when having a normal job, you know how much you can get (salary + bonus) but have no clue on how bad things can be.
