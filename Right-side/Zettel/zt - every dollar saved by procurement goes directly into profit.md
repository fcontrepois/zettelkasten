## Notes
- **Every dollar saved by procurement goes directly into profit!**

## example
Scenario:
Revenue =  
- profit is 5%
- external costs are 60%
- value add is 35%

A reduction of costs by 2% will increase profit by 1.2%, creating a **24%** profit growth.

in numbers
- $1000 revenue
- profit: $50
- external costs: $600
- value add: $350

if we reduce the costs by 2% from $600 to $588, the profit moves from $50 to $62 is a 24% increase.
