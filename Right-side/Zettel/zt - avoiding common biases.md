## Relevant notes
- [[zt - we see based on our narrative]] is how biases enter into our brains. 
- [[zt - it is all invented]] - our narrative too
- [[zt - never assume always test]] as a way to reduce any bias effect for quantitative things
- [[zt - feedback is always welcome]] as a way to reduce any bias effect for qualitative things
- [[zt - we live in a world of measurement]] and most measures are wrong or simply different per individual
- [[zt - most people do not believe something can happen until it already has]] is a bias that deserves a dedicated note
- [[zt - we react more to lose than win]] which is a natural feeling

## Notes
### problems
- Our brain creates a narrative based on what we see more often; this is the *visibility bias*, and it makes us order the frequency of events incorrectly. For example, as a plane crash is more visible than car accidents, we tend to believe that planes are less secure than cars. 
	- Another example is the reason for mortality. We tend to assign very rare events a bigger impact than reality and ignore what is happening the most but is less reported. 
- What I call the *community bias* is then our narratives are reinforced by being in closed communities and ignoring others. Political views, channels, friends and family. 
- Another bias related to project management is to believe that $Time = \frac{work}{people}$ is always true. 
	- It is like believing that you can get a child in a month by having nine women being pregnant in parallel. It just doesn't work!
	- Corollary: do not believe the project management tools; not everything can be done faster with more people. 
- When all you know is the theory, reality seems like a problem to solve
- Avoid falling in love with your first answer
	- Find tools to fight myopia
	- question your judgment
	- the habit of making and recording 
	- ask someone else to give you a new perspective
- **Bystanded effect**
	- when a task is assigned to a group, everyone assumes it will be done by someone else; it is solved by assigning tasks to a single individual. 
- **Curse of Knowledge** when it is clear in your head but not in the recipient one
- **Insider bias** expecting that others have the same knowledge as us on a specific topic.

### solutions
- A way to avoid biases is the method depicted in [[book - World War Z]] where out of 10, 9 agree on something; it is the duty of the 10th to disagree and prove it. 
- Do not fall in love with the first idea unless there is no time to do more
