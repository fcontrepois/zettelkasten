## Notes
- As humans, we are very bad at estimating how long something will take; but we are very good at comparing if something is more complicated than something else.
- [[Scrum]] uses a very intersting concept of stories to define software features, and uses complexity points to estimate the effort needed to implement; the more points the harder the implementation. Over time it is possible to map the numbers of point to a period of time. For example, after some sprints the stats will show that a team can deliver 200 points in two weeks.
