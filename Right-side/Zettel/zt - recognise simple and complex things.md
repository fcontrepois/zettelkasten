## Notes
### Characteristics of simple things
Simplified things are:
- **minimal**: as minimal as possible. There must be enough to get the job done
- **understandable**: they are understandable by novice which have no expertise in the subject
- **repeateble**: easy to scale or replicate
- **accessible**: they are available and transparent to as many people as possible

### complexity can be used against people

### Signs of complexity
1. Too many approval proceses
2. Frustrated customers
3. Coordination overload
4. Too many rules change
5. The end of easy (many forms, long contracts)
6. Mystery rules (stuff that appears our of nowhere)

### Impact of complexity
Stress from complexity is stress without reward
