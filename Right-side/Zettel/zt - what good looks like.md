## Notes
- When having a responsibility of delivering something, either directly, or indirectly as a manager or as a reviewer, it is important to know what good looks like to be able to measure and check quality. 
- When you don't know what good looks like, you depend on the quality of delivery of others. 
- When I did not know what good looked like for people reporting to me, I was not able to validate if they were doing a good work. Sometimes it ended up badly, with me defending people having done a very bad job.
