## Notes
- Your why is the thing you give to the world. 

 To discover your why you need a friend. Ask them:
 - why are we friends?
	 - they will not know how to answer
	 - what is it about me that I know you'll be there no matter what?
 - Play devil's advocate until they start describing themselves, they will articulate the value you have in their life, and you will have an emotional response.
