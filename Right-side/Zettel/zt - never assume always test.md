## Notes
- It is always worth testing as much as possible and learn from it. If talking with people, it is good to test people's ideas too instead of putting words in their mind. 
- Use assumptions as hypotheses to be tested during the negotiation/conversation. Do not commit to them until proven. 
- experiments are fact finding missions [[book - Creativity Inc]]
- When experimentation is seen as a necessity and productive, ot as a frustrating waste of time, people will enjoy their work, even when it is confonding them
- Unless an idea cannot be proven wrong by a fact it is not scientific
