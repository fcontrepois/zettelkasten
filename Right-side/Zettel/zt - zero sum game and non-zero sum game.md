## Notes
- In a zero-sum game when one side wins the other side lose. Most sports are zero-sum games. In business market share can be seen as a zero-sum game.
- In a non-zero-sum game it is possible for different participant in the game to win together. In business this is the equivalent of increasing the size of the market, allowing everyone to grow.
