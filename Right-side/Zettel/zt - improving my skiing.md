## Notes
- Always have the legs pushing forward on the boots. Never be seated on the back of the shoes. This is valid for standard slopes. 
- To do a nice curve push the knee you want towards the slope inside the other knee and flex the body in the other direction pointing towards the slope to put even more pressure on the ski the is 'down'
- I have the silver star level (that's what he says)
