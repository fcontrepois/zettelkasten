## Notes
### Always important
- Get to the point fast
- make it explicit - spell it out

### Subject 
- Summarise email
- help with retrieval
- use the three w - what, who, when from 
- use prefixes urgent, important, FYI
- if all the content is in the subject use EOM (End of Mail)
### 5 sentence email
- Before sending, make sure have an answer for "What do I want the receipient to do or know?"
- Get to the point immediately
- highlight a lack of required response or action
### Long email - divide it in two parts
- Quick summary - 5 sentence or less
- Detail: additional info, include info already in summary. The objective is to add colour and details 
###  Use IF...THEN writing
- to provide **clarity**: If you cannot then …
- explain **assumptions**: if you mean … then …, otherwise, if … then ...
- **accountability**: if I don’t hear from you before … then I will consider it good
-  **reminder**: if you don’t hear from me on … then send me a reminder.
### Avoid mistakes
- Spell out acronyms
-  Reread your entire email to avoid stupid errors
-  check you really reply to the questions asked and be specific
-  You can use deplay deliery to make sure things are received during working hours or as reminders
	-  cc yourself to verify the emails are sent
### Easy reading - scannable
- Use bullet points -> actions/questions
- use subheading & white space
- highlight and bold
### make it simple for the other side
- Don’t end emails with open-ended questions, propose options
- Don’t say when we should meet -> give options

### Show don’t tell - [[zt - show don't tell]]
- Use screenshot - I recommend [[Snagit]]
	- saves time
	- easier for the receipient
	- easy to implement
	- reduce misscommunications

### Reply All
- unicast personal emails
- Mention when you add or remove people at the beginning of the email and why.
- Put a summary of the discussion
- State when you want people to use or not Reply All

### Reply to questions inline
- use a different colour
- copy/paste the question in your email and provide the answer
- separate the questions if the sender has not done it
