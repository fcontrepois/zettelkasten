## Notes
We remember stories better than numbers, so why not build stories to remember numbers? This is what the Sun list is about. Each number from one to twenty has a connection with an image and by building a story from these images you can remember numbers.

Instead of remembering the code 8462 try to build a story about an octopus (8) driving a car (4) while drinking from a can of soda while wearing some bright yellow socks (2)

A method to remind numbers from 1-20, great to use to create stories

1. Sun (there is one sun), 
2. socks (socks are always in couple), 
3. traffic light (traffic light), 
4. car (4 wheels), 
5. star (five-pointed star), 
6. soda (soda is sold in packs of 6), 
7. rainbow (colors), 
8. octopus (8 tentacles), 
9. cat (9 lives), 
10. fingers (there are 10 fingers), 
11. ski (2 skis in the snow are like an 11), 
12. roses (dozen roses), 
13. witch (bad luck), 
14. gold (14 kt for gold), 
15. dollar (1 and 5 overlapped look like the $), 
16. candles (US big birthday), 
17. magazine (classic us mag), 
18. truck (us truck wheels), 
19. golf (18 holes + bar),
