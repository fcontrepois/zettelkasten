## Notes
- we build based on known past, not on unknown future
	- this is why Fukushima's wall were too low, as a bigger tsunami was never registred, until it happened
	- financial crisis protection are only protecting against the last known worst-case scenario
- COVID is a great example. I would have never thought that the world could stop and government put people above the economy at such a scale and for such a time. 
- One exception is the golden gate, created before the discovery of the resonance effect, but build so strong that it is still there standing. 
- Another are the London sewers build 5 time the needed size (at the time) allowing them to cope with the current size of London
- Also valid for positive events, we consider wild positive changes as dreams.
