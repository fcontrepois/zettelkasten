- Notes
	- The education should be focused on the individual talents. It should actively seek to find the talents of student (of all ages). Once a talent is found, a personalised path of education can be built, a path that helps the student learn better, enjoy learning, and be more prepared in an ever-changing world.  
	- A big part of education should be around teamwork. Most work today are done in teams, and the education system should acknowledge that.
