# Measure success to give the right feedback

#permanentnote

## Source
- [[book - Why Simple Wins - Escape the Complexity Trap and Get to Work That Matters]]
- [[book - getting things done (GTD)]] and [[book - the 7 habits of highly effective people]] where you begin with the end (success) in mind.
 
## Keywords (topics and howto)
- [[topic - leading and managing]]
- [[topic - mentoring, advising and coaching]]
- [[how to be a better leader]]
- [[how to avoid common biases (brain shortcuts)]] - when the data is not the credit will go based on the [[zt - we see based on our narrative]] and we will assume. Assuming goes against [[zt - never assume always test]]

## Relevant notes
- [[zt - be proactive]] by allowing measures early
- [[zt - real delegation]] allow for delegated work to be measured
- [[zt - managing mistakes]] is easier when there is data to provide feedback. [[zt - feedback is always welcome]] 
- and anyway [[zt - it is all invented]]
- [[zt - the asyncronous team]]
- [[zt - management and leadership]]
- [[zt - never assume always test]]


## Notes
- Credit should be based on a clear definition of success
- A clear definition of success should always be defined (I need to improve at that)
