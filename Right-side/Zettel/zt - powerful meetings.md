## notes
- Meetings are everywhere and learning how to better manage them is a powerful efficiency accelerator
- [[zt - POMO]] as a way to well describe meeting(s) strategic agenda and should be included in the invite
- Discuss the agenda before the meeting. Use a sentence like *"I thought it would be useful if we talked about BLA and BLA, and then just a bit of on BLA; how do you feel about that approach?"* [[book - The Trusted Advisor]] p103
- The use of the [[zt - perfection game]] at the end of each meeting allows for each participant to be heard and allows the organiser to do better next time. [[zt - feedback is always welcome]]
- If you are the facilitator of a meeting between people that do not communicate often it can be beneficial to contact each participant and ask to share their issues, concerns and objectives.
	- This can be seen as a waste of time by some participants which is why the approach is valid ONLY if you are external (facilitator)
	- If the meeting is between people that are or will work closely together, then it is better to build on the principles of [[book - the five dysfunctions of a team]] and have a productive meeting once and for all. 
- A chairman is a facilitator
	- A facilitator is a Blue Hat in [[book - six thinking hats]]
- If possible try to [[zt - remember people's name]]
- Every action needs to follow the three w - what, who, when from 
	- who cannot be a group due to the  Bystanded effect in [[zt - avoiding common biases]]
