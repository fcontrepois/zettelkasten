## Relevant notes
- this method is based on [[zt - without emotion there is no long-term memory]] 
- [[zt - trust is a must for long term relationship]] remembering someone's name is a great start of trust building.

## Notes
### SUAVE
When you hear a name, you should do the following:
- Say the name immediately, like *hello Jason*
- Use the name
- Ask about the name
- Visualise the name
- End with the name

### Other notes
- Associate a moving image to the name and put it on the person. For me, Jason is the killer in Friday the 13th. For example, I will imagine all Jasons with a hokey mark, a knife and a desire to kill me. 
	- use the name multiple times during the conversation
	- use the name at the end. 
    - Now when I look around a room, all the Jason's have a mask, and I remember the name. 
    - NB: you can also use other emotion, like fun.
