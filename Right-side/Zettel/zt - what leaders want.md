## Notes

Leaders want:
- To get in power
- To stay in power
- To control the money
In other words, a leader wants as much power as they can get and keep it for as long as possible. 
	- in a democracy, this is usually limited; in a dictatorship, no. 


With this simplification, it is possible to explain the behaviour of democratically elected leaders and dictators alike.
