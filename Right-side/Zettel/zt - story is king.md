## Notes
- When people are taken by the story their imagination will fill any blank left. The most impressive story for this is the pixar movie about a bee. The time before the convention was too short, so half of the movie was just made of wireframes and without colours, but most people did not notice as they were so focused on the story. 
- No matter the amount of care you put into artistery, visual polish, and details, it does not matter if you are telling the story right.
