## Notes
### Killing complexity
#### Pre-meeting
List task x day in calendar, only work.
#### Meeting (workshop)
- Each group list five most time consu ing tasks and ask
	- what makes this task such time consuming?
	- Are the majority of the tasks daily/weekly
	- Can we change the timing of the tasks (daily -> weekly)
	- Is this a duplication?
#### Next
- For each task, define a level of complexity, with one being very complex and four very simple. And ask:
	- Was it hard to assign a level of complexity?
	- Did an identical task receive a different level of complexity from different teams?
	- Are most task in one area of continuum?
	- What about the group at large?
	- Are certain category of task in the same continuum?
	- If most tasks are complex, what is the rest?
#### Put the task in a two-by-two 
Create a two-by-two matrix with complex->simple as x, and low-value->high-value for y
ask the following questions while placing the task:
- Does the task solve a problem? No, then kill.
- Does the task fullfill a customer need?
- Does the task provide insight and allows for a better decision?

#### Brainstorm

### Kill a stupid rule
- Identify stupid rules (15 minutes)
- Is it an internal or a customer rule?
- Kill it or modify it
