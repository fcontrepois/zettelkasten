- Creative ideas need shaping and tailoring. 
	- You can transform a new idea into a usable idea by bringing constraints (Need 1)
	- shaping an idea into somting that can be accepted by the ones doing it (Need 2)
- Any new idea that gets killed needs to have a reason attached to it that can be communicated to the inventor
