## Example 1
- Getting students to clarify their thinking and explore the origin of their thinking
__e.g__., 'Why do you say that?', 'Could you explain further?'
- Challenging students about [assumptions](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/assumption)__e.g__., 'Is this always the case?', 'Why do you think that this assumption holds here?'
- Providing [evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence) as a basis for [arguments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument)__e.g__., 'Why do you say that?', 'Is there reason to doubt this evidence?'
- Discovering alternative viewpoints and perspectives and conflicts between [contentions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_contention)__e.g__., 'What is the counter-argument?', 'Can/did anyone see this another way?'
- Exploring [implications](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/implication) and [consequences](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/consequence)__e.g__., 'But if...happened, what else would result?', 'How does...affect...?'
- Questioning the question
__e.g__., 'Why do you think that I asked that question?', 
'Why was that question important?', 'Which of your questions turned out 
to be the most useful?'

## Example 2
1.  Clarifying your thinking and explaining the origins of your ideas (Why do I think this? What exactly do I think?)
2.  Challenging assumptions (How do I know this is true? What if I thought the opposite?)
3.  Looking for evidence (How can I back this up? What are the sources?)
4.  Considering alternative perspectives (What might others think? How do I know I am correct?)
5.  Examining consequences and implications (What if I am wrong? What are the consequences if I am?)
6.  Questioning the original questions (Why did I think that? Was I correct? What conclusions can I draw from the reasoning process?)
