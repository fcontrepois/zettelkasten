People say that I'm an optimist. I'm afraid I have to disagree! My form of optimism comes from life teaching me that getting depressed never helps to get through difficult times.

So as often as possible, I flip the coin and create a positive narrative. Almost every dark coin has a shiny one, just one flip away.

When I exhausted all the positive angles, then I became very pessimistic.
