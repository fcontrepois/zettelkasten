## Notes

Too often smart people find an elegant solution then build the problem, without checking if the problem is real and for whom. Selling a solution for a problem that does not really exist is a perfect way to fail. So here comes the TIPS method

DO the following steps by thinking as the customer, so as to first look for a problem, then use your brains to find solutions.

- First look for **Trends**; the facts, what you really know.
- Then move to **Implications** that are consequences that can be deduced from the facts. This can be a set of problems.
- The P stands for **Possibilites** what would help?
- Finally look for **Solutions**
