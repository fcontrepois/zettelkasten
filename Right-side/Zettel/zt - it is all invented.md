### Story 
A shoe factory sends two marketing scouts to a region in of Africa to study the prospects for expanding business. 

One sends back a telegram saying:
SITUATION HOPELESS STOP NO ONE WEARS SHOES

The other whilres back triumphantly.
GLORIOUS BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY STOP THEY HAVE NO SHOES

 ### The practice**
   Ask yourself
   "_What assumption am I making, that I'm not aware I'm making, that gives me what I see_"
   and then when you have the answer ask yourself:
   "_What might I now invent, that I haven't yet invented that would give me other choices_"
