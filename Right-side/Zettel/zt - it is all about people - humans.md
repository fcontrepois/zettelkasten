 ## relevant notes:

	- [[zt - we live in a world of measurement]]
	- [[zt - we live in a world of fear for survival]]
- [[book - the wolf in CIO clothing]] introduces the idea that being always nice is good, but when the approach does not work, you need to be ready to change.

## notes
- Every important decision is, in the end, made by a person
- Ignoring the human part will limit the extent of an impact
- Humans are emotional (i.e. non-rational) first and foremost. 
	- We make the decision emotionally, and then we rationalise to explain why we made the decision. 
- Take time to discover the person. For example, in meetings, make an introduction at least.
- Focus on what you don't know, on what is different
- People need 
	- affirmation
	- approval
	- support
	- appreciation - clients don't always want advice; sometimes, they need a sympathetic ear.
- Positive management, which includes most of the article in the section  [[how to be a better leader]], is a perfect best practice until it does not work anymore. At that point, the leader must be ready to try other, usually 'less nice' methods. 
	- This is excellent advice to manage upward (your boss and above) and down (your team).
