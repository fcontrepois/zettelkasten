## Notes
- You cannot change the cue or the craving or the reward, the only thing you can change is [[zt - the habit loop|the routine]] 
- You need to believe that the change can happen to make it permanent
- Use the [[zt - the five why]] to get to the root cause of a problem and change that core thing. 

### Framework to change a habit
1. Identify the routine
	-  easy
2. Experiment with rewards:  identify the craving the habit is covering
	- Try other rewards by doing something different from the habit
		- Jot down the first 3 things in your mind after trying.
		- Wait 15 minutes.
		- do you still have the craving?
1. Isolate the cue: Identify areas of investigations:
		- Location, 
		- time, 
		- emotion, 
		- other people, 
		- last action done
2. have a plan: change the habit, not the cue nor the reward.
