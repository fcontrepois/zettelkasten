## Notes
### Tips to improve sentences 
- write to your grandma; she is smart but not on top of the latest in your area of expertise. 
### Do
- make the sentence short
- make the sentence immediate, getting to the point quickly
- add people instead of having dry theoretical sentences
- use punctuation to add some rhythm and structure.
- use poetic sentences to add rhythm
- use the power of three when using lists
- stick to what is necessary: how much does your audience care about what you are writing
- bring drama by focusing on actions and emotions. 

### Donâ€™t do
- Do not loose the sense of direction. Organise things that are connected together, for example all the positive and then all the negative
- avoid back-referencing
- avoid using "former" and "later"
