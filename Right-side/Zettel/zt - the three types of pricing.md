## Notes
When setting a pricing pick one of the following approaches.

### There are three types of pricing
1. Cost based. Cost = direct costs + indirect costs + overhead + markup
2. Market pricing = see the prices of competitors and choose where you want to be (high, low, very low)
3. Value based -> identify benefits for the customers, quantify them into money and set a price based on the value for customers.
