### Tips for better use of words
- Choose precise words
- Avoid jargon and tech words as they create a distance from the reader
	- Enable -> allow
	- facilitate -> make possible
	- provision -> provide or supply
	- actualize -> make happen or reach
	- generate -> make or create
	- enact -> do
	- implement -> carry out
	- visualize -> see or imagine
	- consequently -> as a result
	- developed -> made or create
- Use words to create a picture, not an abstract concept.
- Use colourful words. Default to simple words and use colourful ones to enhance.
	- Colorful words create a picture; for example, the colourful version of "Developed" could be "Crafted."
- remove implicit words
- order words, for example, first emotional, then physical
- write numbers until ten. Use *one* instead of *1*
