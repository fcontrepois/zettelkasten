- Relevant notes
	- [[zt - it is all about people - humans]] we are all humans so non-rational beasts
	- [[zt - remember people's name]] is another basic thing in romantic that we often do not do in business. Probably because the emotions are not automatic (as with love) and need to be artificially created. 
	- [[zt - trust is a must for long term relationship]] this is valid for both romantic and work relationship that are planned to be long-term
	- This association can help people better understand what we are trying to achieve when we talk about [[zt - be client focus]]

- Notes
	- While the approaches will be different, it is almost always possible to associate a positive (or negative) behavious in a romantic relationship with an equivalent in business. For example brining flowers for no reasons can be converted with bringing insights for no reasons (and for free).
