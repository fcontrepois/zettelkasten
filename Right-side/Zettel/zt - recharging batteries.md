## Notes
- To live a balanced life it is necessary to recharge the batteries, and that is, not to work at **all**.
- This is like the story of the two lumberjacks, working exactly the same hours. The one that disappears one hour everyday consistently cuts more wood. The other asks 'What do you do when you disappears? I go home and sharpen my axe'. In an intellectual economy, sharpening your axe happens when you recharge your batteries (you do not work at all).
