## Notes
### In education 
-  In the book, giving and A, is a way to remove grades in an educational environment, while keeping high quality of learning. 
- **The exercise**
	- You have an A (the best grade); now, write a letter in the future explaining how you've achieved your grade A and how you have changed as a person. You should be in love with that future self.
	- For any team (inc. students): this is not about grades but recognizing that each individual wants to be part of something bigger than them. So as a leader, do not complain about the person; assume their intentions are in the right place ([[zt - giving an A]]) and ask
	- The goal of the exercise is to remove anything in the way of the student to develop skills mastery and self-expression. Like the quote 
	> I saw the angel in the marble and carved until I set him free. - Michelangelo
	
	By writing the letter the student is seeing the angel they want to be and can start acting to carve it out.

### In life
- Assume people have the best of intentions, and most of the time, it is true. You will build  trust much faster, so meaningful relationships, than someone starting from being suspicious. [[zt - trust is a must for long term relationship]] 
	- A word of caution: be ready if you are wrong. Start with the assumption that people have the best of intentions, yet test it, by paying attention at behaviours with you, with others, and with the task at hand.
