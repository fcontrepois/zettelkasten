## Notes
- Be proactive is to be responsible for our own lifes
- As humans we have the freedom to choose between stimulus and response via self-awareness, immagination, conscience and independent will. 
- We can control our reaction to a stimulus and so control our lifes.
- Proactive people are value driven, not stimulus driven
- You cannot be hurt without you concent. 
- Being proactive means being able to intercept the instinctive reaction to an event and make a conscient decision before acting. It is about being human and having a say between action and reaction.
- The instinct is always stronger than the thinking [[book - The chimp paradox]], unless there was a conscious work to prepare the reaction [[book - the 7 habits of highly effective people]]. This can be done by using immagination to see and feel the event and override the default approach.  
- Take responsibility for your reaction to your experiences, take the initiative to respond positively and improve the situation. Recognize your Circle of Influence and Circle of Concern. Focus your responses and initiates on the center of your influence and constantly work to expand it. Don't sit and wait in a reactive mode, waiting for problems to happen (Circle of Concern) before taking action - [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_7_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People#1_-_Be_proactive)
- Instead of judging our way forward we need to create it, focusing on what can be. From [[book - six thinking hats]] but connecting with [[zt - it is all invented]] by allowing to be invented
