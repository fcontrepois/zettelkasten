## Notes

- Be extreme regularly to remind people of your different colours. Be exteme on a regular basis.
- There is not safe middle in leadership.
	- I prefer "There is not safe middle for a strong leader"

### Grey
While a leader's default approach to internal politics should be a positive one, where they are friendly, if the political landscape is not encouraging being nice, a leader must be ready to be sometimes black (let me try to get you out of my way), sometimes white (let's help each other), most of the time grey (you don't help me, I won't help you). The approach is Machiavellian and works better in a pack of grey leaders. 

### Light
The Light leader is inspirational and empathetic; you want to be part of their team. 
That is the default colour until the political landscape shows that grey is a better colour. 

### Dark
Being dark is working with fear; it is about creating and enforcing compliance
The dark side is useful for:
- protect territory and followers
- take a calculated risk
- it helps be respected by other dark leaders and helps build alliances
