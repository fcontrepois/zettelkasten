## Notes
- When focusing on a single target the consequence is that there are many things that you need to say no to. Those are trade off. 
- Low costs airlines are all about trade off, focusing on low cost means saying no to anything that could add more cost, even if that would be better for customers.
- Essentialist focus on "what do I want to be big on", and to make trade-offs of anything that does not help achieve the goal.
