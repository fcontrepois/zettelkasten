### Story
Before releasing the Walkman, Sony asked which color people would prefer, yellow or black? Yellow was the clear winner. Sony then did an event where they asked the question again, and again the answer was Yellow. At the exit of the show, each participant could take a Walkman for free, either yellow or black, and most people took the black one. Yellow was the stated preference, black was the revealed preference.
