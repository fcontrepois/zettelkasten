## Relevant notes
### Advisor
- [[zt - be client focus]] and merge your client's todo list with yours
- [[zt - on being a good advisor]] your todo list is the client's todo list in your area
- [[zt - all customers want someone that takes away their worries and problems]] but you should not take them on you unless you are here to do that.

### Team and personal
- [[zt - intent based leadership]] move things from your todo list to someone elses when they are closer to the information
- [[zt - separate the thinking from the doing]] as a way to think if that is in your todo list
- [[zt - reduce the amount of information coming in]] by selecting based on what matters to you, you will reduce the amount of information coming in. For example when you change role at work, people will still try to give you tasks from your old position. 

## Notes
- very often we are asked to do stuff that really are not for us to do. It should be a decision [[zt - be proactive]] to accept the task or not. 
- Your todo list should help you achieve your goals not others.
- If a sentence starts with "Can you do..." it is about someone else todo list.
