- various

## Keywords (topics and howto)
- [[topic - my core beliefs]]
- [[topic - personal efficiency]]
- [[topic - leading and managing]]
- [[topic - mentoring, advising and coaching]]
- [[how to be a better leader]] - it takes time to implement things
- [[how to make better decisions]] - decisions are easy, like ideas. The implementation is the hard part. 

## Relevant notes
- [[zt - slow it down]] - few things at a time to be completed
- [[zt - let them lead]] - if you are a leader, let them have ideas, but also carry the implementation bid
- [[zt - show don't tell]] - be part of the implementation
- [[zt - auto-healing team]]
- [[zt - leading from any chair]] make sure you allow the people implementing have ideas, and unless it accelerate the current implementation, delay implementation
- [[zt - hire brains not skills]]
- [[zt - begin with the end in mind]] the idea is the end, and you need it, yet the way to get there is what is hard to do
- [[zt - the basic principles of life]]
- [[zt - separate the thinking from the doing]] but do both
- [[zt - avoid falling in love with your first idea]]
- [[zt - never assume always test]] you need to finish the implementation of an idea to be able to test. Even if it is an minimum viable product (MVP)
- [[zt - managing mistakes]] as ideas are often bad
- [[zt - to get one good idea you need a lot of bad ones]]

## Notes
- It is easy to have ideas, it is easy to be distracted by new ideas, it is easy to drop the previous idea and move to the new one, it is hard to do the work that makes and idea happen. 
- People with ideas are often frustrated by the time and effort it takes to implement an idea. 
	- It takes time to learn to be patient - I still work on it 
	- try to get at least to an MVP stage
