## Notes:
- This is the GTD approach 
	- You mind goes through five steps to accomplish virtually any task. These five steps are:

	- Defining purpose and principles
	- Outcome visioning
	- Brainstorming
	- Organizing
	- Identifying next actions

	Letâ€™s take an example and work through these five steps. The example I am going to use is the booking of a family holiday.

	The first step in the model is to define purpose and principles. Think about the last time you booked a family holiday. There is always a purpose for the holiday. This could be to take a well earned break from work, to relax and spend quality time with your spouse and children, or simply to go and see a specific tourist attraction whilst on your holiday. Whatever the reason, there will have been purpose and principles for your trip. You donâ€™t just get up one day and goon holiday, you implement stage one of the natural planning model and this is to have a purpose for the trip.

	The second step is outcome visioning. Once you had defined a purpose and the principle for your holiday, the next thing you will have done is to have a vision of the outcome, in other words, where do you want to go, when, and who with? This is classed as aoutcome visioning as you are thinking about the outcome of your holiday and making mental notes about what you want the outcome to be.

	The third step is brainstorming. This brainstorming is normally done within your mind, and also other people are usually included when the project or decision impacts upon them. For example, lets say you think about the Maldives for your holiday, but you are going in June. The brainstorming aspect will look at this and probably decide that as June is the rainy season in the Maldives, it may not be the best time to visit. This is a naturally creative aspect of your brain that helps narrow down the vision of the outcome into a definite decision. I say other people are included because for projects such as planning a holiday, you also have to take other peoples viewpoints into consideration. I am sure your spouse would have something to say if you booked the holiday with consulting, and brainstorming their viewpoints on the suitability of the trip and destination choice.

	The next, and fourth step is organizing. Once you have generated your ideas about the project, or holiday in this case, you start to organize these ideas. For example, you may have thought about the travel agent to use for the booking, or whether to book direct, if the in-laws would like to come on the vacation also to double as baby sitters ðŸ™‚ etc. Your mind normally sorts and organizes these thoughts automatically.

	The last, and fifth step is to identify and set the next actions. The GTD methodology covers that the best way to get a task done, is to decide and set the next actions. We do not do tasks, we do next actions. So the best way to get your holiday booked is to decide what the next actions are. These normally would be items such as, look up the resort on the Internet, check online travel comparison sites for cheap flights and accommodation, call in and see a travel agent for their price and recommendation within the resort. Again, I would be surprised if any of you would take the time and effort to write these next actions down, but also, I would be surprised if any of you forgot these next actions. it is funny how our mind has a great way of remembering projects assigned and planning using the Natural Planning Method.
