## Relevant notes
- this is a tool for the [[zt - chief simplification officer]]
- while delegating ([[zt - real delegation]]) make sure people are not adding layers of complexity to the processes
- [[zt - transparency as a way to reduce bureaucracy]] as being transparent can help identify the negatives created by added layers of burocracy

## Notes
- We donâ€™t add complexity as a choice. We add a layer on top of what is there to solve an issue, making the overall stack slightly more complex. And this get worst the more layers are added.
- Solving a problem by adding controls will increase complexity.
