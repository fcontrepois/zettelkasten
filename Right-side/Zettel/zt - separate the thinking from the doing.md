# Separate the thinking from the doing
#permanentnote 

## Source
- [[book - getting things done (GTD)]]
- [[book - Wardley Maps]] are a great tool to separate the thinking from the doing

## Topics
- [[topic - personal efficiency]]
- [[topic - leading and managing]]
- [[topic - information management]]

## How to
- [[how to implement gtd]] - GTD is based on a separation of thinking and doing. You think once a week during the weekly review and do the rest of the time.
- [[how to be a better leader]] as a leader, you help the thinking, but you let others do the doing. 
- [[how to be a better writer]] 

## Relevant notes
- [[zt - ask a lot, shut up and listen]]
- [[zt - begin with the end in mind]]
- [[zt - chief simplification officer]]
- [[zt - get to that is right]]
- [[zt - do your homework]]

## Notes
- In every methodology, I recommend separating the moment used to think about stuff into periods when we have lots of energy from doing, which can be done when energy levels are lower. 
- The OODA loop follows the same approach but for real-time activities
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) separated the editing, the thinking, from the viewing.
- Most things to do benefit from some reflection first. 
- If there is no time to think – like in healthcare or while driving – then thinking is done once, very early, and transmitted by training.
