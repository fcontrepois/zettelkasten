- Notes
	- As a professional, you should show to clients potential oppotunities to work together. You should do this only if it would be very unprofessional not to do so. 
	- There are 3 possible options of upsell/crosssell
		1. **Expand** - Adding new service to an existing relationship
			- Talk with the new person that will deliver the new service and let them choose if they are qualified. Then go toghether to the customer 
		2. **Broaden** - selling the same service to a new client
			- the obstacles
				-the sponsor (existing customer) must understand the others person's business.
				- the sponsor must use credibility with the oter person's business
				- The sponsor will think "what's in for me?" 
			- the approach
				- The advisor must beleive that by not providing the help would be unprofessional and that the help of the existing client is needed to ensure that the client organisation gains in the significant benefits at stake. 
		3. **Diversify** - selling a new service to a new client - very very hard
			- Needs lots of work before it happens 
			- You must be fully convinced that there are no reasons NOT to do the deal
			- Bring everyone (i.e. you, your client, new prospect, new advisor) and show
				- all the parties invested serious time
				- the problem is well understood
				- the expertise is real and known
				- everyone interest is genuine
				- everyone knows everyone
