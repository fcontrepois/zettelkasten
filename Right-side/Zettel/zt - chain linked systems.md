## Notes
- A well managed chain link sytem is hard to replicate. But a chain linked system that is not-optional will require every node to be brouhg up without great results, hense chain liked stackss are a massive pain. 
- Few resources require tight integration with made to measure components and clever design and coordination. More resources require less tigh integration and the use of standard components. 
- When calculating the cost of delivery, make sure to include also the cost for the customer to understand, buy, travel and build. 
- **Entropy**, all things tend to decay, competent management need to work consistently to keep things stable
