## Notes
- From Peter Drucker and Warren Bennis: *"Management is doing things right, leadership is doing the right thing"*
- Leadership will tell which jungle to go into, manager will sharpen machetes for the doers that are moving forward. It is the leader's job to climb on a tree and say: "Wrong jungle" and usually get the answer "Shut-up we are making progress".

### A definition of leadership
> Leadership is the responsibility to see those around us rise. It is taking care of those in our charge. Simon Sinek
