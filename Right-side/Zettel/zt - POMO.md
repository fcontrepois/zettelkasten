When preparing a meeting, it is best to have an agenda, describing what the meeting is about. Having an agenda is a recommendation found in every "how to make a good meeting" book. But as often in business, the theory is well explained, yet the practical steps about implementation are left to guess. So here is a tip, learned at [Strategic Blue](https://www.strategic-blue.com) to create meaningful meeting's agenda.

It goes like this **POMO**

- P stands for Purpose, what is the purpose of this meeting or this series of sessions?
- O is for Objective, what is the Objective of the meeting. For single-shot meetings, this is very often the same as Purpose. For a series of meetings, this is the Objective of this meeting.
- M is for Method, how will this meeting be managed, is it a demo, presentation, debate, brainstorming?
- O is for Outcome, what do we expect to get out of the meeting.

Try it, it works! Let me know, in the comments, if POMO helped you and if you have other ways to set meaningful agendas.
