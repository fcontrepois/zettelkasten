## Notes
- When we are surprised by a bad our first instinctive reaction is emotional. Announcing a bad news in a group of people is sure to generate blame and provide little space to find solutions. 
- When you have a bad new to share with a group of people, discuss it with each person in private. People can be emotional in private, then start looking for a solution. When the group meets, no one should be surprised by the news, and everyone will have ideas to deal with the problem.
- Good news can be announced at any time.
