## Notes
- When we are in a simple place, like the shower, our brain is free to be bored and to wander. Resulting in great ideas. The same can happen when you run for example. 
- 2 minutes brainstorming is the oposite of the previous approach. Give yourself two minutes to get as many words on a specific topic. The, unreal, stress triggers creativity fast. It works great in groups. 
- The thing that works for me is a fast walk with nuraphone and epic or a selected list of hard Rock songs. There is nothing better to drag me out of melancholy and get new ideas.
