## Relevant notes & Notes
- [[zt - entropy]] so simplicity needs to be continously helped
- [[zt - go first]] lead by example
- [[zt - chief simplification officer]]


1. Thinking that it can be done in isolation
2. Starting with the big issues. It is better to start with a simple process that people can solve so that they can act and see results.
	- [[zt - slow it down]] and start by doing and finishing one thing
	- [[zt - let them lead]] in the end simplification is everyone's job
3. Thinking that roganising is simplifying. [[zt - simplification is about removing stuff]]
4. It is a one-off exercise. Like everything, simplification is subject to decay with time, what is called [[zt - entropy]], and need continuous work to stay in place.
