## Notes


### White hat purely factual, no interpretations
Data, data without though like a computer

Include asking questions like:
- How to get the data?
- What data is needed?
- What is missing?
- What do we need to ask?
- How do we get the info?

There are two types of facts under the white hat: checked facts and believed facts. Checked facts are proven, believed are heard or remembered. A believed fact needs to be checked to be used further. 

### Black: survival, conservative view
- The black hat statement must be good in print
- Be as cautious as possible
- Find problems BUT NOT SOLVE. Solving is yellow hat. 

### Red: emotions, how do I feel
- Red Hat is about emotions in the now, unfiltered, without the need of an explanation. Takes 5 seconds max per person
- Useful when used at the beginning and the end of meeting

### Yellow: positive, can do it approach
- Effectiveness rather than novelty
- Optimisit with a follow up. Can be acted on it!
- Generation of proposals, improvement of proposals, positivie assessment of proposal

### Green: creative, finding new solutions
- Creativity
- New ideas
- We could do this, we could do that...
- Not old ideas, that is yellow
- have new ideas and see where they could get us
- [[zt - new ideas need protection]]

### Blue: organiser
- Facilitator (Chair/Leader)
- It is a great way to stay out of the meeting
- The blue hat focuses on the meeting
