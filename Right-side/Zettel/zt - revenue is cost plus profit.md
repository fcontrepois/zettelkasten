## Notes
- Revenue is cost + profit
- Usually in P&L document you get that revenue - cost = profit. Yet simply moving cost on the other side of the equation offers a new view it gets obvious that reducing cost will increase profit. And that reduction in cost is the work of procurement. 
- 70% of costs of a company are external costs that procurment manages.
