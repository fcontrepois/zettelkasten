## Notes
We focus on only four things with our eyes

The number of slides is not important. The problem is the amount of stuff on a slide.

###  Stuff moving
- So make it move
- This can be used with contrast, when you change the contrast between bullet points
### Big stuff
- The most important part of your slide should be the biggest
- Invert the font size of the template:
	- make the title small
	- and the content big
### Contrasty stuff
- use dark background
- highlight the one important things in bright white
- put the rest in not-so-bright white
### Small number of info at the same time
- Maximum 6 objects in a single slides. The brain will identify them without effort in 0.2seconds. Simply getting to 7 objects requires 1.2second of effot!
- Avoid using sentences when speaking at the same time
