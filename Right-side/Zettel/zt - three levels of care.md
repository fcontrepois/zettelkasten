## Notes
When thinking about goals or performance, I find it useful to to focus on three depth of work.

### Life
In life, when setting priorities and goals, I use the following three levels to guide my choices:

1. Me
2. My family
3. The world I have some influence over -> [[zt - the circle of influence and circle of concern]]

### work
At work I will ask one goal that helps you as a person, one goal that helps the team, and one that helps the company.

1. You
2. Team
3. Company
