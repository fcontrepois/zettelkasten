- Notes
  - In the [[book - The Trusted Advisor]] there is a trust equation that goes like this:
    - $$Trustworthiness = \frac{Credibility + Reliability + Intimacy}{Self-orientation}$$
  - Credibility is about diplomas and honesty
  - Reliability is about action correlated with concistency. 
                - Under-promise, over deliver
  - Intimacy is about emotional closeness with the issue at hand. Creating intimacy requires courage. [[zt - go first]]
  - Self-orientation is the negative aspect of the equation and is about a desire by the advisor of being seen on top of things, to just to conclusions or the desire to be right.
  - Self-orientation is visible when customers cannot finish their sentences, filling empty spaces, name dropping of other clients, being too quick to answer.
