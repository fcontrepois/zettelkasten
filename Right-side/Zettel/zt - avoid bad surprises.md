## Notes
When you need to say something bad that is going to be unexpected, make sure to communicate the info individually.

For example during a board meeting, do not announce bad news without having first talked with each person first. This courtesy allow for everyone to digest the new, get over the emotional part, thinking ahead of time. Allowing for better group decisison.
