There are several steps you can take to help you avoid common biases:

1. Recognize and acknowledge your biases: The first step in avoiding biases is to be aware of them. Consider taking an implicit bias test to help you identify your own biases.
    
2. Seek out diverse perspectives: One way to counter biases is to expose yourself to various perspectives and experiences; this can help you see issues from multiple viewpoints and make more informed decisions.
    
3. Practice mindfulness: Being mindful of your thoughts and behaviours can help you catch yourself when falling into biased thinking. Pay attention to the language you use and the assumptions you make, and try to be open to new ideas and approaches.
    
4. Use decision-making frameworks: Structured approaches to decision-making, like the Six Thinking Hats or the Kepner-Tregoe method, can help you consider multiple perspectives and approaches to a problem.
    
5. Get feedback: Seek out the perspectives of others, particularly those with different backgrounds or experiences, to help you identify and address any biases you may be unaware of.
    
6. Educate yourself: Learn about different biases and how they can affect your thinking and decision-making; this can help you become more aware of your biases and how to address them.
    

By following these steps, you can help reduce the impact of biases on your thinking and decision-making. It is also important to remember that it is normal to have biases, and it is a continuous process to work on reducing them.
